HOOKS
Hooks are needed in React to use state and lifecycle features inside functional components, making the code more reusable, cleaner, and easier to manage.

--> Problems Before Hooks and How Hooks Solved Them (Normal Text Format)

1. Functional components couldn’t use state or lifecycle methods.
→ Hooks like useState and useEffect allow functional components to manage state and handle side effects.

2. Class components were harder to read and maintain.
→ Hooks make the code much cleaner and easier by allowing us to write everything using functions instead of classes.

3. Sharing logic between components was difficult (using HOCs or render props became messy).
→ Hooks enable easy logic reuse through custom hooks, making code more organized.

4. Complex components became hard to manage because lifecycle logic (like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, etc.) was spread across multiple methods.
→ useEffect combines all related side effects in one place with clear dependencies.

5. There was confusion with the ‘this’ keyword in class components.
→ Hooks completely remove the need for this, making the code simpler and error-free.
