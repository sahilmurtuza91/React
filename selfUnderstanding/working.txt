--------HOOKS---------
Hooks are needed in React to use state and lifecycle features inside functional components, making the code more reusable, cleaner, and easier to manage.

--> Problems Before Hooks and How Hooks Solved Them (Normal Text Format)

1. Functional components couldn’t use state or lifecycle methods.
→ Hooks like useState and useEffect allow functional components to manage state and handle side effects.

2. Class components were harder to read and maintain.
→ Hooks make the code much cleaner and easier by allowing us to write everything using functions instead of classes.

3. Sharing logic between components was difficult (using HOCs or render props became messy).
→ Hooks enable easy logic reuse through custom hooks, making code more organized.

4. Complex components became hard to manage because lifecycle logic (like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, etc.) was spread across multiple methods.
→ useEffect combines all related side effects in one place with clear dependencies.

5. There was confusion with the ‘this’ keyword in class components.
→ Hooks completely remove the need for this, making the code simpler and error-free.

---------------understand how useState works-------------------------
In React:
let [counter, setCounter] = useState(15);
counter holds the current value of state (say 15).
setCounter() schedules a state update — it does not immediately change the value of counter.
React may batch multiple setState calls for performance reasons.
That means — multiple setCounter() calls in one event handler are combined before React re-renders.

🔍 Case 1 — setCounter(counter + 1)
Let’s see what happens step by step if counter = 15 initially:
setCounter(counter + 1);
setCounter(counter + 1);
setCounter(counter + 1);
What React sees internally
In the first call, you pass setCounter(16)
In the second call, you also pass setCounter(16) (because counter is still 15 — React hasn’t updated it yet)
In the third call, again setCounter(16)
➡️ React batches all updates and finally applies the last one → counter becomes 16 only.

❗ Because counter was read once at the beginning (15),
all three updates used the same stale value (15).
So, even though you wrote it three times, React thinks:
“Oh, you want to set counter to 16 again and again. Fine, I’ll just make it 16.”

🔁 Case 2 — setCounter(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1)
Now when you do this:
setCounter(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1);
setCounter(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1);
setCounter(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1);
React sees functions, not fixed values.
Each time React runs these functions during batching, it uses the latest updated value of prevCounter.
Internally it’s like:
First call → prevCounter = 15 → new value = 16
Second call → prevCounter = 16 → new value = 17
Third call → prevCounter = 17 → new value = 18
✅ So final value = 18 (increased by 3)

----- Tailwind----
---> Website fot the tailwind is https://tailwindcss.com/ from here we install tailwind 

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework, meaning it provides small reusable classes for styling instead of writing custom CSS.
##  In tailwind img tag is self closing tag so we have to make it closing by adding / before 
## In tailwind for the name of class we use className insted of class only

------props-------
Props (short for “properties”) are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.
Why we use props:

Dynamic Content:-->Each component can show different data without duplicating code.
Reusability:-->You can reuse the same component with different props multiple times.
Parent → Child Communication:-->Props are the standard way to pass info from one component to another.

-------How Tailwind CSS and Props Work Together-------

Tailwind CSS and props complement each other:
Props define what content or data the component should display.
Tailwind defines how that content should look visually.
